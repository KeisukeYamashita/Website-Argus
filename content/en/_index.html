Hymenaios provides a way for you to monitor the versions of software and trigger alerts when a
new release is been found.

It provides a Web UI for your viewing pleasure, and this UI allows you to approve new releases which could, for
example, send a GitHub-style WebHook to an AWX server to trigger a Playbook that updates to that new version.

Alerts could also be in the form of Slack and/or Gotify messages (Gotifications?).
